            Hey @${{ github.actor }}! 👋
            
            Thank you for submitting a PR! We highly appreciate your efforts towards improving this project! 🙏
            
            To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:
            - Make sure that your branch name adheres to the Contribution Guidelines for the repository. 
            - Verify your PR is **up-to-date with origin/master.** If your PR is behind origin/master update by running the following, replacing 'feature' with the name of your local branch:
                ```sh
                git remote add upstream https://github.com/sayak-sarkar/sayak-ci-demo.git
                git fetch upstream
                git checkout feature  # <----- replace 'feature' with local branch name
                git rebase upstream/master
                git push -u origin -f
                ```
            - Verify all Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.
            - Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."_  -Bruce Lee
